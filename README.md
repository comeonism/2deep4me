2Deep4Me [otherwise known as 'To Deep Fore Me']
-----------------

Some say this is one of the best projects created by Aleks on the 5th of March 2017 (yeah, no one says that). 

Basically, there's some stars in the background, a moon too. There's some sort of a flat ground-like surface and a dude walking on it. As he walks - dozens of #deepthoughts tweets fly by in the sky. That's literally it. 

If you want to try it out yourself - do it. Clone the repo, add your *OAuthAccessToken* and *OAuthAccessTokenSecret* to the _config.properties_ file, modify the hashtag if you want, do a gradle build, run the jar. It might take a while for the thing to load, Twitter4j is slow, or Java is slow, or something else is... listen, I don't, it might take a while for it to load, okay? Okay.
